          <h2> Offense overview </h2> 
          <p>Since everyone in Ultimate play defense there are only two positions in ultimate:  handlers and cutters. These determine your main role in the offense. Handlers focus their movement around the disc and their primary goal is to throw the frisbee upfield for yards, however they also move the disc amongst themselves in order to get open options. Cutters focus their movements more downfield with the primary goal of making space and catching the disc downfield for yards. While oftentimes cutters will throw the disc back to the handlers (who have moved up to meet the disc) they can also throw to each other to progress down the field. What kind of offense a team runs will be determined on what the defense decides to do. There are two main kinds of offense types, ones responding to person defense and ones responding to zone defense. </p>
        </div>
        

        <div class="o2 all">
          <h2> Person Offense </h2>
          <p> Against a person defense there are two main types of offense, vertical stack and horizontal stack. Both of these rely on the cutters standing downfield either parallel or perpendicular to the endzone with the handlers lined up with the disc. However, the movement patterns and order for both of them differ.</p>
          <h2> Vertical Stack </h2> 
          <p> In a vertical stack, cutters will make their cuts from the back of the stack (the end farthest from the disc). Always make sure all other cutters have cleared out of the space you intend to move through before beginning the cut. Cuts either go deep (towards the endzone) or under (towards the disc). In order to create space between you and the defender cuts need to be sharp changes of direction, not horizontal, curved or straight in one direction. They should resemble a check mark, or the letters N and M. After completing the cut and nearing the handlers, if the disc has not been thrown clear out of the way and return to the stack.
          <br> <br>
          For handlers  You will line up relatively even with the disc horizontally. Once the player with the disc starts looking to the handlers one will begin their cuts. The typical movement is either up the field at an angle to get open in front of the player with the disc, or faking up and returning back for an easy throw horizontally (this is a more complicated concept than cutters and the video goes into much better detail). After obtaining the disc the handler’s job is to look for upfield throwing options and if none presents themselves look back to the other handlers.	
          </p>

          <h2> Horizontal Stack </h2>
          <p> In a horizontal stack, cutters form a horizontal line.  They are making under and deep cuts, but in the process of doing so, are often working with a teammate.  If one player cuts under and then goes deep, then the corresponding teammate will cut deep and then under, thus making a triangle.  The two "active" cutters are the two most in line with the handler with the disc.  Once these cutters clear out, then the other two cutters will fill in.  If you are using two main cutters, then they will just continue to cycle back in. Handlers in a horizontal stack operate fairly similarly to the first video about general handler cutting.</p>

        <div class="o3 all">
          <h2> Zone Offense </h2>
          <p> In zone offense players set up almost identically to a horizontal stack, and cutters have poppers and pistons however the movement is very different.
          <br><br>
          In zone the two poppers (the middle two cutters) work together to find and make spaces in the zone where handlers can throw to them. The pistons/wings mirror each other. While the disc is on one half of the field the piston closest to the disc makes an in cut towards the disc to gain yards while the other piston on the opposite side of the field is cutting deep further downfield to help stretch the field and spread the opponents zone. When the disc is swung (thrown) to the other side the pistons exchange spaces and the piston who was deep cuts under while the other player cuts deep. Overall zone offense tends to be much more fluid and less structured so these are more general instructions as the roles especially poppers allow for more creativity.
          <br><br>
          Most of the disc movement in a zone will come from the handlers. Working together they move the disc between themselves to open up opportunities to throw it to the cutters. Handlers often utilize either a dump throw (a short throw to another handler which allows for the restarting of the stall count) into a swing to the other side of the field, or they cut directly up in front of each other to move the zone. </p>
