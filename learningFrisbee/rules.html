         <h2> Overview </h2>
         <p> Ultimate frisbee is self officiated, meaning that the players on the field make their own calls. It is then up to the person who was called out for a foul or infraction, to contest (disagree) or no contest (agree). What happens as a result of the call is determined by the contest or no contest. If the call wasn’t obvious there is normally a discussion between the two players, and if there is still confusion someone with a better view of the play or knowledge of the rules can be consulted. After there is a call made play will stop until it is resolved.
         <br> <br>
         In ultimate seven players per team are on the field at a time. The field has a width of 40 yards, with a central playing area of 70 yards capped by two end zones both 20 yards deep, however it is a very fluid game and in the event that both teams agree the dimensions can be altered. A game starts with both teams lined up in their respective endzones, the team starting on defense will pull the disc to the other team, meaning that they will throw the disc towards the opposite endzone as far as they can and then follow it down to begin playing defense. The team starting on offense picks up the disc from wherever it lands and play begins. Players are not allowed to move while in possession of the disc however they are allowed a pivot foot which they set when they pick up the disc, and they must throw the disc within ten seconds. A turnover occurs when the disc hits the ground (regardless of which team touched it last), when the defending team catches it or when the disc lands out of bounds (in ultimate the line is considered out of bounds). A goal is scored after a team catches a throw inside of the endzone. After this the point resets, teams substitute players and the team who scored stays in the endzone and pulls the disc, they are now scoring in the opposite endzone. The length of games vary by tournament and league however they can either go for a time limit, a point cap or a combination of the two.
         <br> <br>
         In ultimate, when an infraction has occurred the players on the field may make the call. To do so yell the infraction, or if you are unsure the exact name foul/violation and discussion ensues. If you decide that there was in fact no infraction you may also revoke your call. There are many rules in ultimate that you will need to learn eventually but here are some of the most common ones.
         </p>
        <h2> Some more specific rules </h2>

        <h3> The pull </h3>
        <p> Every point starts with the pull, where the team that scored the last point throws the frisbee as far downfield as they can for the other team to pick up. If the pull goes out of bounds, the frisbee is brought to the middle of the field (width wise) and roughly the same level as where it went out. A player is allowed to catch the disc, but if anyone touches the disc, and it is then dropped it is a turnover. Off sides can be called if a player on either team advances past their goal line before the pull has been thrown. </p>

        <h3> Being inside the goal line </h3>
        <p> It is up to the player who caught the frisbee to determine if they were within the endzone, however if they are unsure they can ask the people around them for input. </p>

        <h3> Traveling </h3>
        <p> It is considered a travel if the person with the disc loses contact with the ground with their pivot foot, or does not immediately slow down and stop after catching the disc. If the player with the disc has made their throw play stops, the disc goes back to the thrower, unless the pass was incomplete, in which case it is a turnover. If the disc has not been thrown then play does not stop and the player with the disc returns to where they were before the travel was committed. </p>

        <h3> Contested Possession </h3>
        <p> When a person of both teams catches the disc at the same time, possession is awarded to whoever stopped the rotation of the disc. If that is still unsure or it is a tie, then the disc is awarded to the offense.</p>

        <h3> Catching your own throw </h3>
        <p>You are only allowed to catch a disc you have thrown if someone else has touched the dic. </p>

        <h3> Strip </h3>
        <p> A strip occurs when someone on the other team forces the disc out of the hands of the player who is in possession. This is a foul, and does not count as a turnover. Possession reverts back to the player who originally had the disc and the stall count starts at 1. </p>

        <h3> Pick </h3>
        </p> A pick occurs when the defending player is obstructed by another player on the field as a result of the movement of the offensive player they are guarding. An obstruction can count regardless of whether or not there was contact and the player obstructing can be from either team. If the pass was thrown and incomplete then it is a turn over, or if at any point after the pick a turnover occurs before the pick is resolved the turn over is upheld. If the pass was not thrown or it is determined that the defending player would not have had a play on the disc regardless, then the disc remains with whoever has possession and the defense is allowed to catch up with the offensive player. If the pass was completed and the defensive player is deemed to have had a play on the disc then the disc is returned to the original thrower. </p>
