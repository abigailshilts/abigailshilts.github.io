          <h2> Stall Count/Mark </h2> 
          <p>The mark is the defensive player guarding the offensive player with the disc. The person marking changes depending on what offensive player has the disc (in a zone it often is the same person who continues marking). The goal of the mark is to take away certain throwing options of the player with the disc. They do so by standing at least a disc’s width away and using largely their arms and also their body to take up space in the way of the thrower. The defensive player marking will also be counting to ten (you should be able to say “stall” between each number). This is called the stall count. If the mark gets to ten and the disc has not been thrown it is a turn over.</p>

          <h2> Person Defense </h2>
          <p>This is the more common type of defense. With this type of defense defenders will choose a single offensive player to guard for the entirety of the point. Person defense relies heavily on the force, which refers to a specific type of positioning of defenders. With the force, the mark will position themselves on one side of the mark taking away the throwing option on that side of the field, while down field the defense will stand on the side of the offense opposite that of the mark. This can be a fairly complex concept to grasp, so the video to the right should help to create a more visual and in depth explanation.
          <br><br>
          While guarding a cutter, the goal of the defense is to match their movements and beat the offense to the disc or potential throw while maintaining their positioning on the force side.
          <br><br> While guarding a handler, aim to position yourself between the player with the disc and the player you are guarding, and then match the handler as they make their cuts to prevent them from having clean access to a throw.</p>

          <h2> Zone Defense </h2>
          <p> In zone defense instead of being assigned an offensive player to guard defenders are assigned areas of the field to guard. There are many types of zones that teams will run, and will teach you. The most common one is a cup zone where three or four people will spread out around the disc in the shape of a rough quarter circle with the goal of giving the thrower very limited options. Two or three people called wings or the wall will make a row behind the cup blocking the space in the middle of the field, if the frisbee is in the air in their general vicinity, it is their job to go and get it. The deep stands behind the middle row protecting the deep space and attacking any long throws.</P>
